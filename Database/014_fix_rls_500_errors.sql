-- ============================================================================
-- FIX RLS 500 ERRORS - Update policies to work with your auth setup
-- ============================================================================
-- The 500 errors happen because auth.uid() doesn't match user_id in users table
-- We need to either:
-- 1. Link auth users to app users via auth_user_id column
-- 2. OR temporarily use a simpler policy for developers

-- ============================================================================
-- OPTION 1: Temporarily disable RLS for testing (RECOMMENDED FOR NOW)
-- ============================================================================
-- This will let us verify the app works, then we can fix auth properly
